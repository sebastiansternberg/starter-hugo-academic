I am a Senior Data Scientist working at KPMG Lighthouse, KPMG's Center of Data & Analytics in Germany. I mainly work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) topics, especially on information extraction from documents, e.g. invoices, contracts or form sheets. I also like to serve as a translator between non-technical stake-holders and the tech team. 

Before, I completed my PhD in 2019 at the Graduate School of Social Science and Economics at the Chair for Quantitative Methods at the University of Mannheim. During my PhD, I mainly worked on the application of machine learning approaches to political science questions, with a particular focus on predictive modelling and text analysis, e.g. predicting constitutional court decision-making with machine learning and measuring vagueness in judicial texts.
